VICE apps in Cyverse's Discovery Environment
--------------------------------------------

[List of VICE Apps in DE](https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/vice/en/latest/vice_apps/examples.html)

see [Making VICE Apps](#making-vice-apps) below

PatMatch-Binder and VICE app
----------------------------

[PatMatch Binder and Vice App Github repo](https://github.com/fomightez/patmatch-binder)

[Example PatMatch at the Yeast Genome Database](https://www.yeastgenome.org/nph-patmatch) - In particular look at the 'Supported Pattern Syntax and Examples' at the bottom

Circos-Binder and VICE app

### Alternatives

Other tools for similar circular (and non-circular) visualization. This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing.

#### Command-line/ Script based

- [Chord diagrams](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/chord.html#)
- [CIRCULAR PLOT â€“ CIRCLIZE PACKAGE (2)](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/123-circular-plot-circlize-package-2/)
- [karyoploteR](https://bernatgel.github.io/karyoploter_tutorial/#Examples) - for linear
- [EasyFig](https://github.com/mjsull/Easyfig/wiki/Example-1.-Simple-genome-region-comparison) - for linear and sub-regions
- [Donut plot with subgroups](https://python-graph-gallery.com/163-donut-plot-with-subgroups/) to contrast [Circos with highlights (specifically bottom plot here)](http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/highlights/recipe2/images) .

#### Webtools

- [Circos Online](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/tableviewer/)
- [Circa](http://omgenomics.com/circa/)($) and Chordial ($)
- [CiVi: User-friendly Circular Visualization for microbial genomes](http://civi.cmbi.ru.nl/) but limited to the microbes (currently 2773) they have

Jupyter and Binder
------------------

**Importantly** Jupyter is langauage agnostic!  
What I covered here today only touched on Python and the bash shell languages because the fromer is the language I presently work in most often. However, Jupyter can host an R kernel and the hub can even serve RStudio. Other langauges are possible too.

Training
--------

- [Learning at CyVerse](https://www.cyverse.org/learning)

- [The Carpentries: Teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide](https://carpentries.org/) - There lessons form the basis of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops. Lots of the lessons and content are available to explore or schedule a workshop.

- Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute - See [here](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/index.html) for the [advertisment for the 2019 version of Titus Brown and Colleagues' Sequence Analysis (ANGUS)/Data Intensive Biology Summer Workshop](http://ivory.idyll.org/dibsi/ANGUS.html). Registration for this year closes soon, but be prepared for next yeat by [joining the dibsi-announce mailing list](https://groups.io/g/dibsi-announce/join). **The course content for recent years (plus more done by Titus and DIBSI is shared [here](https://dib-training.readthedocs.io/en/pub/).**
