# Resource listing to Wayne's May 17th Cyverse Talk

Resource listing for accompanying Wayne's Cyverse talk on the PatMatch and Circos Binders and VICE apps (May 17th, 2019).

PatMatch-Binder and VICE app
----------------------------

[PatMatch Binder and Vice App Github repo](https://github.com/fomightez/patmatch-binder)

[Example PatMatch at the Yeast Genome Database](https://www.yeastgenome.org/nph-patmatch) - In particular look at the 'Supported Pattern Syntax and Examples' at the bottom

Circos-Binder and VICE app

### Alternatives

Other tools for similar circular (and non-circular) visualization

#### Command-line/ Script based

- [Chord diagrams](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/chord.html#)
- [CIRCULAR PLOT â€“ CIRCLIZE PACKAGE (2)](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/123-circular-plot-circlize-package-2/)
- [EasyFig](https://github.com/mjsull/Easyfig/wiki/Example-1.-Simple-genome-region-comparison) - for linear and sub-regions
- [Donut plot with subgroups](https://python-graph-gallery.com/163-donut-plot-with-subgroups/) to contrast [Circos with highlights (specifically bottom plot here)](http://circos.ca/documentation/tutorials/highlights/recipe2/images) .

#### Webtools

- [Circos Online](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/tableviewer/)
- [Circa](http://omgenomics.com/circa/)($) and Chordial ($)
- [CiVi: User-friendly Circular Visualization for microbial genomes](http://civi.cmbi.ru.nl/) but limited to the microbes (currently 2773) they have

Making VICE Apps

Jupyter
-------

**Importantly** Jupyter is langauage agnostic!  
What I covered here today only touched on Python because that is the language I presently work most often in, but Jupyter can host R kernel and the hub can even serve RStudio.
